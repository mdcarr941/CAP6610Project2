Dependencies
============

The code in this project is written for Python 2.7. The following libraries are
required: sklearn, numpy, and GPy. All of these are available in the PyPI and so
can be installed easily using pip.


Usage

Simply run
```python
    import group12_code
```
to import all the code for the project. The calling conventions of each function are
documented in the functions themselves and are available from the interpreter by
calling
```python

```
Tests for the project are located in
